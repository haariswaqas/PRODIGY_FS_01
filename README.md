# üõ°Ô∏è Django & React Authentication System

This project is a simple authentication system built with **Django** for the backend and **React** for the frontend, featuring token-based authentication using **JWT (JSON Web Token)** with access and refresh tokens.

## üöÄ Features

- **User Registration & Login**: Users can securely register and log in using token-based authentication.
- **Token Authentication**: Implemented using Django REST Framework's Simple JWT. The access tokens expire after 90 minutes, while the refresh tokens last for 50 days with automatic rotation.
- **Profile Management**: Users can manage their profiles after registering. Profiles are automatically created upon registration.
- **Custom API Endpoints**: Created API endpoints using Django‚Äôs generic views for managing users, profiles, notes, and more.
- **Secure Permissions**: Only authenticated users can access and modify their own data. Permission classes are used to ensure user data protection.
- **Token Rotation & Blacklisting**: Refresh tokens are rotated after each use, and old tokens are blacklisted to enhance security.

## üìö Lessons Learned

1. **Authentication & Authorization**: 
   - Implemented JWT for token-based authentication and authorization.
   - Validated and handled token expiry, rotation, and security concerns.
   
2. **REST API Development**: 
   - Built efficient, secure REST APIs with Django and DRF.
   - Utilized generic views and custom endpoints for handling profile updates, notes, and other resources.

3. **Security Best Practices**: 
   - Set up short-lived access tokens and long-lived refresh tokens for better security.
   - Implemented token rotation and blacklisting to prevent unauthorized token reuse.

4. **Front-End Integration**: 
   - Developed the frontend using React, ensuring a seamless user experience.
   - Integrated JWT token handling on the client-side to manage access and refresh tokens efficiently.

## üîë Token Authentication

- **Access Token Lifetime**: 90 minutes _(ideal range: 15-60 minutes)_
- **Refresh Token Lifetime**: 50 days _(ideal range: 7-30 days)_

These values can be adjusted in the Django settings for `SIMPLE_JWT` as needed.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Django, Django REST Framework, Simple JWT
- **Frontend**: React, Axios
- **Database**: SQLite _(can be changed to PostgreSQL or any other DB)_
- **Authentication**: Token-based (JWT)
